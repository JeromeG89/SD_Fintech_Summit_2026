## Contribution guidelines

This project is developed using **Next.js**, with automatic routing based on the file structure within the `src/app/` directory. Each folder corresponds to a URL path, and every `page.tsx` file within those folders defines the content for that specific route.

For example:
- The `page.tsx` file in `/src/app/about/` will render when you navigate to `/about` in the browser.

---

### Key Routing Folders

- `src/app/positions/page.tsx` â†’ `/positions`

#### Components

- Page-specific components are housed in the `src/app/components/(page)` directory.
